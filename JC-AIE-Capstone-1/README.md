# Capstone Project 1 — Job Connector AI Engineering

This repository contains the Capstone Project 1 developed as part of the Job Connector Program — AI Engineering at Purwadhika Digital Technology School.

## Project Overview

This Python program is created to demonstrate the essential skills learned throughout Module 1 of the program, which includes:

* Fundamentals of Python Programming
* MySQL Database Concepts and CRUD Operations
* Data Visualization
* Git and GitHub Workflow

The purpose of this project is to combine all learning outcomes into a mini-application that reflects real-world problem-solving using Python.

## Technologies Used

| Category       | Tools                                                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Programming    | Python                                                               |
| Database       | MySQL                                                                |
| ORM / Querying | (adjust based on your code: SQLAlchemy / mysql-connector / pure SQL) |
| Others         | Pandas, Matplotlib (if applicable)                                   |

## Objectives

* Apply Python to build a functional program
* Implement CRUD operations with MySQL database
* Practice clean and modular coding structure
* Manage project using Git and GitHub

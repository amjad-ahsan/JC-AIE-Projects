# Daegu Apartment Price Regression Prediction

Apartment prices in Daegu vary significantly based on factors such as size, building age, location, and nearby facilities. Without proper analytical support, sellers may overprice or underprice their properties, making it difficult for buyers and property owners to determine whether the listing price aligns with true market value.

This project uses machine learning techniques to create a data-driven model for predicting apartment sale prices.

## Project Objectives

* Build a machine learning regression model that predicts the sale price of apartments in Daegu based on property characteristics.
* Identify the most influential features that drive apartment value.
* Provide a pricing tool to help sellers, buyers, and real-estate agencies make informed, market-aligned decisions.

| ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| MAE (Mean Absolute Error)      | ≤ 40,000 KRW |
| RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) | ≤ 50,000 KRW |
| R² Score                       | > 0.80       |
